# Chess Escape

## Overview
Chess Escape is a unique twist on traditional chess, where you control a single chess piece and navigate through 10 levels to reach the opposite end of the board without being captured. The game focuses on strategic movement and careful planning, as enemy pieces will move only when they can capture you. 

## Features
- **10 Levels**: Each level presents a different board setup and enemy piece arrangement.
- **Board Customisation**: Change the board color to your preference in the settings.
- **Simple Yet Challenging**: Unlike traditional chess, survival is key—you must avoid capture at all costs.

## Rules
- **This is NOT traditional chess.**
- **Objective**: Reach the opposite end of the board to complete a level.
- **Enemy Movement**: Enemy pieces only move when they can capture you.
- **No Captures**: You cannot capture enemy pieces.
- **Threatened Squares**: Landing on a square threatened by an enemy piece results in a loss—even if it's the last square!
